# Airport Service Desk

The software aims to enable airport employees to easily report issues and requests related to the information system. Each report will be labeled and automatically directed to the appropriate IT support department for resolution. Furthermore, the solution will empower staff to independently resolve common problems using a knowledge base, reducing the IT department's load and speeding up issue resolution.

Creating manuals for common problems will allow the IT support department to educate Help Desk users, ultimately reducing the number of reports. Additionally, the software will include a forum where system users can ask further questions not covered by the knowledge base, with responses from other users.
